I am an economist holding a PhD from the [Central European University](https://economics.ceu.edu/) (CEU). I work as a data scientist at [Emarsys](https://www.emarsys.com/en-uk/) in Budapest and also occasionally teach at CEU. I have done empirical research on online news and earlier on numerical dynamic programming. I am an enthusiastic R user and I also like working with Python. Playing pingpong, tasting pastries and reading are my favorite hobbies.
